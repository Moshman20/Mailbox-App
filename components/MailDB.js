How are things with your girl friend nw Rosalia talking with her son, John a Confederate soldier, who unexpectedly returns from the front to see her. He comes burning with questions and a desire to unburden himself about the meaning and the brutality of war as well as unanswered questions about his life before he left. The play follows a long conversation between the two of them. Rosalia owns her own estate with its slaves and John tries to convince her to improve their lives and to give them an education. She loves her son, and she agrees to do what he asks of her for them.",

Finally he caught my gaze… I pressed my face against the window and whispered, “My name is Callisto!” Do you believe it? I used to call myself Callisto in those days… The train suddenly started up. We pulled out of the station. I watched him get smaller and smaller. Then I fell into a deep sleep. I began having nightmares… I was being chased down this long tunnel… I started to scream. Someone grabbed my hands. I opened my eyes. It was him! He’d jumped on the train at the last minute and was sitting across from me, eyes laughing, poppies blazing… He didn’t speak a word of any language I knew, but he held me spellbound.",

You’ve never seen such feverish carryings-on… He rocked me over mountains, sang me through rain forests, and kissed me past ancient cities. Oh, what a ruckus we made! Well, you’ll do it too, you’ll do it all, wait and see. We ended up in Zanzibar, island of cloves. I was so full of him, I thought my heart would burst. Zanzibar! Come on, jump with me",

Present company always excepted, all women, great or little, are insincere, crooked, backbiters, envious, liars to the marrow of their bones, vain, trivial, merciless, unreasonable, and, as far as this is concerned [taps his forehead] excuse my outspokenness, a sparrow can give ten points to any philosopher in petticoats you like to name! You look at one of these poetic creatures: all muslin, an ethereal demi-goddess, you have a million transports of joy, and you look into her soul—and see a common crocodile!

It proves that all our ideas were real after all. Our ideas of what Sergius would do -- our patriotism -- our heroic ideals. Oh, what faithless little creatures girls are! -- I sometimes used to doubt whether they were anything but dreams. When I buckled on Sergius’ sword he looked so noble: it was treason to think of disillusion or humiliation or failure. And yet -- and yet -- Promise me you’ll never tell him. Well, it came into my head just as he was holding me in his arms and looking into my eyes, that perhaps we only had our heroic ideas because we are so fond of reading Byron and Pushkin, and because we were so delighted with the opera that season in Bucharest. Real life is so seldom like that -- indeed never, as far as I knew it then. Only think, mother, I doubted him",
